DaltonView is a simple GUI which allows the user to make adjustments to the parameters used to plot the TD-DFT vertical excitation spectrum. Spectra are generated by applying probablility density distributions to each excitation and it's oscillator strength. Currently, only outputs from Gaussian or Q-Chem are supported. It is my goal to make this app work for more quantum chemistry programs. If you have any requests for updates, feel free to send me a TD-DFT output from your desired program and I will add it to the list!
